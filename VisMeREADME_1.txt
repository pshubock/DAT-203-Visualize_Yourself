# ATOMIC HABITS #

"Atomic Habits" are small regular actions that can be consciously built into clusters of linked actions, or habitual behaviors. The recent book by James Clear is a popularization of neurological and psychological research that studies how to create and maintain the behaviors we want - and to eliminate those we do not. See:  https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits

This program will help the user to define habits they want, cluster them in time, and establish supports that help make them habitual. The program will also collect data about habit ual behavior and allow the user to see a dashboard overview with helpful analysis and visualization tools. 

Importantly, the program will allow the user to identify overall life goals that the user believes will result from the programmed behavior. uesion: Does adopting a set of beneficial habits in each dimension improve overall wellness? For example, several different habits may contribute to the goal of weight loss. By linking habits to each intended goal, it will be possible to determine whether a goal is actually met when a specific habits are performed. 

A habit and a goal may be quantative or qualitative, or some combination. Quantitative data may include, for example: sleep duration, social interactions, bills are paid, body weight, amount saved.  Qualitative data may include more adaptive emotions and positive feelings, and fewer maladaptive emotions and negative feelings by the user and/or others.
